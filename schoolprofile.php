Sharnbasveshwar Residential Public School</p>
<p>
The establishment of Sharnbasveshwar Residential Public School in 1967, the brainchild of His Holiness poojya Dr. Sharnbaswappa Appa, has fulfilled the long felt need of the people of this region, who carved for excellent education. The idea is to impart education in the most modern and scientific method, with English as the medium of instruction to the children hailing from the rural areas of the country, who are generally denied this privilege. Equally important, is to inculacte in the minds of the growing children the great and timeless values of culture, tradition and heritage of this great country.

The school became a Residential School in 1970 and was recognised by the Indian Public Schools Conference in 1993. The School conforms to the excellent standars of education and more significantly, its endeavour to make available to the people of this region, the Public School education, which was then affordable only to the elite and princely class, is commendable.

It is a secular institution open to the children of all communities. Especially, it caters to the educational needs of the children living in the rural areas of the region.
