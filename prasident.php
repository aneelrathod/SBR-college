            <h6><p>In the lineage of this great philosophy, the seventh descendant of Mahadasoha Peetha, Poojya Doddappa Appa came as a saviour for the people of this backward region, which was suffering the undue double yoke of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Britishers. It was Doddappa Appa's firm belief that no creature should be a victim of slavery because he perceived that spirit resides in all creatures. This spiritual attitude and outlook of Poojya Doddappa Appa paved the way for the freedom movement. Back in 1918 when the First World War was still going on and when Osmania University was established in the Nizam's State, Poojya Doddappa Appa established Sharanabasaveshwar Public Library in Gulbarga region to create awareness and awaken the people of this region.</p>
